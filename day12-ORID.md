ORID Practice:

Objective (O) [What did we learn today? What activities did you do? what scenes have impressed you?]

We learn about how to combine AI prompting, generative ai idea, user journey, user persona, elevator pitch today with 
interactive activity as a team. I think the scenes that we draw different persona and jouney by our own impressed me.

Relection: Impressive

Interpretive:

For the lesson today, I think it can help me learn more about how AI can help us in building user profile.
Especially as a developer, we usually focus on building the solution instead of thinking about user, so it
is a good chance for me to learn more about how to think out side the box.

Decisional: 
I will try to understand more on the user side and adopt the AI technology in my future work.
