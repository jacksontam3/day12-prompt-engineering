GUIDE Framework Prompt
Goal: Generate an As-Is User Journey to analyze the current experience of users when booking movie tickets and attending a movie without using the new movie reservation website.

User: The target audience is moviegoers who currently face challenges such as long queues, lack of social coordination, and inefficiencies in the booking process.

Instruction: Create a detailed As-Is User Journey that outlines how users currently book and attend movies. Include the main activity, concrete behaviors, a mood curve to show emotional highs and lows throughout the journey, opportunities to improve the process, the user's goal, and a realistic scenario to ground the journey in context.

Details:

Main Activity: The process of planning, booking, and attending a movie.
Concrete Behaviors: Describe step-by-step what the user does (e.g., searching for showtimes, standing in line for tickets, coordinating with friends via messaging apps).
Mood Curve: Reflect emotional changes (e.g., frustration when waiting in line, excitement when entering the theater, etc.).
Opportunity: Identify pain points (e.g., time wasted in queues, difficulty aligning schedules with friends, or missing out on snacks due to time constraints).
Goal: The user wants a seamless, enjoyable movie experience with minimal effort.
Scenario: For example, "A 25-year-old professional plans a Friday night movie outing with friends after work but runs into issues with ticket availability, long wait times, and poor coordination."
Examples:

A mood curve that starts neutral (searching for movie options), dips into frustration (waiting in line or coordinating with friends), and rises to excitement (finally sitting in the cinema).
A pain point such as a user spending 20 minutes buying tickets, only to find preferred seats unavailable.
An opportunity like offering an online platform to book tickets and snacks in advance, avoiding delays and improving the user experience.
